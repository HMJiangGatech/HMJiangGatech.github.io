### About Me

I am principle scientist at Amazon Generative Foundation Modeling Team.
Before I joined Amazon, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Machine Learning from the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering ([ISyE](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/))
at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). 
I spent wonderful years with [Prof. Tuo Zhao](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~tzhao80/) in the FLASH (Foundations of LeArning Systems for alcHemy) research group.
I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from the School of the Gifted Young at University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/)).

My research focuses on generative AI, large language modeling, deep learning and open-source software for data analysis.
