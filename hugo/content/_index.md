### About Me

I am a 3rd year PhD student in the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering ([ISyE](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/))
at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). Before I joined Georgia Tech,
I received my B.S. Degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from the School of the Gifted Young at University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/)).


My research focuses on deep Learning, adversarial machine learning, natrual language processing and open source software development for scientific computing. I am working with [Prof. Tuo Zhao](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~tzhao80/) in the FLASH (Foundations of LeArning Systems for alcHemy) research group.
